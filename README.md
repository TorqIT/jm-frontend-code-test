# Torq IT Frontend Dev Test

## Format

The test contains two parts:

### Small challenges

In `{repo}\challenges\src` there are three JS modules which represent tasks. They should take about 15 minutes each, please choose two of the three to complete.

### Larger task

in `{repo}\classic-cars\` you'll see the larger challenge. Only spend about an hour on it, and we care about thought process and approach, not just results. Given that, please commit your work regularly (every 5-10 minutes at minimum) so we can follow your work. The task is a frontend interface that needs to be setup to work with a real REST API.

## Environment setup

You'll need Git, NodeJS, an IDE (like Visual Studio Code), and familiarity with Javascript or Typescript.

To run the tests for the challenges, in `{repo}\challenges` run `npm install` then `npm run challenge-1`, `npm run challenge-2`, or `npm run challenge-3` for each challenge respectively.Then, install the app dependencies in each folder run:

To run it in `{repo}\classic-cars\` run `npm install` then `npm start`. Detailed instructions are in `{repo}\classic-cars\index.tsx` and the file you will likely work in is `{repo}\classic-cars\src\PaginatedCarsTable\PaginatedCarsTable.tsx`.

Once the desired task is running, you will be greeted by the development server instructions in your terminal, either:

- Showing you the test results, or;
- Showing you the URL for the development web server
